			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Hello! My name is Michael Edelstone and I’m a 42-year-old software designer/developer working remotely. My current home base is San Marcos, Texas, where I rent a little house. I often do extended stays in various cities and am also considering a move in the near future. When I'm not on-the-job, I hike, watch movies, fix bicycles, cook, and take road trips.</p>
			<p>I have a 13-year-old, 50-pound <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/NgCfeXFpNXnYUSYD3">Australian Shepherd mix dog</a>. She is well-exercised, hardly ever barks, and is rarely left unattended. I’m way past the partying stage, don’t smoke, and have infrequent guests. I take immaculately good care of the places I live, report issues promptly, and pay on-time, 100% of the time.</p>

			<h2>What I’m looking for</h2>
			<p>I'm looking for a stand-alone house with 0-1 bedrooms, a full kitchen, and no shared walls or roommates. A space that is well-cared for, modern, and clean. A cottage, guest house, or garage apartment has worked well in the past. A quiet place with no excessive street, dog, construction, train, or human noise, and no nearby smokers is essential. Remote locations are great, but since I work from home regularly, fast and reliable internet is important.</p>
			<p>I’m highly flexible on terms if the house meets these qualifications.</p>

			<h2>Major pluses</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Bundled utilities with rent</li>
				<li>Furnished (if I'm staying for a short while)</li>
				<li>Country setting or remote from neighbors</li>
				<li>Central (or very efficient) heating and cooling</li>
				<li>Ability to obtain very fast internet, with personal access to the router for troubleshooting</li>
				<li>Dog-friendly and close to trailheads</li>
			</ul>
