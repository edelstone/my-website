			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Hello! My name is Michael Edelstone and I’m a remote software designer/developer at <a href="https://kuali.co">Kuali</a>, a Utah-based company making applications for higher education. I currently live in San Marcos, Texas and work remotely from home or local coffee shops during the week. On the weekends I watch movies, cook, sleep, and take road trips.</p>
			<p>I’m 40 years old and I have a 13-year-old, 50-pound <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/NgCfeXFpNXnYUSYD3">Australian Shepherd mix dog</a>. She is well-exercised (we don't need a yard), never barks, and is rarely left unattended. I’m way past the partying stage, don’t smoke, and have infrequent guests. I take immaculately good care of the places I live, report issues promptly, and pay on-time 100% of the time.</p>

			<h2>What I’m looking for</h2>
			<p>I’d like to live in a stand alone rental house with 0-1 bedrooms, a full kitchen, and no shared walls or roommates. A space that is well-cared for, modern, and clean. A small house, guest house, or garage apartment has worked well in the past. A quiet place with no excessive street, dog, rooster, train, or human noise, and no nearby smokers is essential. I don't do well with noise, especially outdoor dogs and parties, but I love animals and am happy living near liverstock and horses. Since I work remotely, fast and reliable internet is a must.</p>
			<p>I’m highly flexible on lease terms and price if the home meets these qualifications.</p>

			<h2>Major pluses</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Country setting or considerably remote from neighbors</li>
				<li>Central (or very efficient) heating and cooling</li>
				<li>Ability to obtain very fast internet, with personal access to the router for troubleshooting</li>
				<li>Washer and dryer inside the unit</li>
				<li>Bundled utilities with rent</li>
			</ul>
