			<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

			<p>The Texas State homepage hadn&#8217;t been updated since 2009. It utilized a condensed, “above the fold” approach and wasn&#8217;t optimized for mobile devices. Brand elements, color, and typography were dated or not systematic, and there was a heavy reliance on image snippets to achieve design objectives. Students and younger employees would frequently say a change was overdue.</p>

				<p class="caption"><b>Before:</b> The Texas State homepage in June 2014</p>

			<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="#prototypes">Responsive</a> and accessible</li>
				<li>Respect existing information architecture</li>
				<li>Handle <a href="#alerts">emergency messaging</a> in a clear, sensible way</li>
				<li>Highlight social media channels</li>
				<li>Be the centerpiece of a <a href="/portfolio/texas-state-brand">new, purposeful digital brand strategy</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

			<p>This project closely followed the development of the university’s <a href="/portfolio/gato-cms">primary template</a> and <a href="/portfolio/texas-state-brand">style guide</a>, in which most brand elements and content patterns were intensively iterated upon and finalized. Much of the process involved applying these patterns to existing items, adapting content to a more-scrollable interface, and adding some key features to aid in recruitment and institutional politics.</p>

			<h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>

			<p>Using Balsamiq gave me the opportunity to really push its limits as a tool, and to create some sophisticated mockups that resolved a majority of the design decisions quickly.</p>

			<h3 id="prototypes">Prototypes</h3>

			<p>With the mockups as a fairly strict guide, the rest of the design came to life in <a href="https://edelstone.github.io/txst-homepage/">a high fidelity, responsive prototype</a> built on a <a href="https://purecss.io/grids/">Pure.css grid</a>. I made choices about interactive effects as I built it, and approved it with stakeholders row-by-row. Overall the build took about a month of dedicated work, with 90% of the markup and styles making it into the final product. <a href="https://github.com/edelstone/txst-homepage">The source code is on GitHub</a>.</p>

			<h3 id="going-live">Going live</h3>

			<p>We turned on the new site at the beginning of 2016, making some key improvements to site search and adding various performance enhancements in subsequent iterations.</p>

			<h2 id="features">Noteworthy features</h2>

			<h3 id="alerts">Emergency alerts</h3>

			<p>Surveys indicated that approximately 35% of the Texas State community checked the university homepage to confirm details in an emergency. After comprehensively studying a couple dozen peer institutions, and researching the broader issues of designing for stress, I identified the following must-haves:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>easy to read, click, or tap on any device</li>
				<li>located at the top of the screen; push all content down</li>
				<li>unique pattern unlikely to be confused with marketing objectives</li>
				<li>international symbology</li>
				<li>accessible and color blind-friendly</li>
				<li>timestamp indicating last update</li>
			</ul>
			<p>After testing several options, a consensus was reached with university police, the president’s cabinet, and several informal test groups. The <a href="https://edelstone.github.io/txst-homepage/alerts">live demo is on GitHub</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="retrospect">Is it perfect?</h2>

			<p>Nope. But everyone was really happy with the results. If I could change anything it would be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>It’s too flat:</b> The site could really use some background patterns, gradients, or overlapping elements to add depth.</li>
				<li><b>Content strategy is dated:</b> University websites are slowly becoming more recruitment and user focused, favoring data over politics. We weren’t able to change that this time around, but we laid the groundwork for a strategic shift.</li>
				<li><b>Medium-width device layout is lazy:</b> For simplicity everything collapses to a single column at 800px. Given more time, I would’ve liked to play more with multi-column layouts from 480px to 800px.</li>
			</ul>
