			<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

			<p>Plano Cycling is the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/plano-cycling-and-fitness-plano">highest-rated bike shop in Texas</a> and one of the first shops to go online. They use <a href="https://smartetailing.com/">SmartEtailing</a>, the most popular CMS in the outdoor industry, to publish content. While boilerplate templates are easy to set up and manage, they require a lot of customization to achieve a unique look and feel. Their site was difficult to interact with on mobile devices and lacked a distinct visual language and voice.</p>

			<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

			<p>The in-store experience at Plano Cycling is regularly praised for the staff&#8217;s exceptional customer service ethic and the shop&#8217;s airy, well-organized spaces. We wanted the digital experience to replicate this as closely as possible. Specifically I set out to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Deploy a unique and deliberate <a href="#graphics">graphical style</a></li>
				<li>Make the website <a href="#mobile">mobile-friendly</a></li>
				<li>Organize information sensibly and feature brick-and-mortar services</li>
				<li>Improve online sales and product discoverability</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

			<p>I chose a template from about two dozen baked-in options, and quickly moved into a design phase that included some <a href="#mockups">Photoshop mockups</a>, lots of content creation, and some custom CSS. The process took about 4 months, and the site was published in March 2013.</p>

			<h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>

			<p>After learning how the template functioned, I was able to produce a basic Photoshop mockup highlighting key pages. I had near-complete freedom on the design, but this allowed me to share preliminary ideas with leadership and wrap my head around the task. I also created a primary color palette inspired by the Plano Cycling logo, historical print collateral, and the overall store environment.</p>

			<h3 id="css">CSS</h3>

			<p>My biggest contribution to this project was the addition of a well-organized and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fplanocycling.com%2Fdir%2F176%2Fcss%2Fpcf_custom_styles.css&profile=css3&usermedium=all&warning=no&vextwarning=&lang=en">standards-compliant CSS file</a> containing the template overrides and brand elements that make the site stylistically unique. I also added a couple plugins to power font icons, sliders, and various other widgets.</p>

			<h2 id="features">Noteworthy features</h2>

			<h3 id="mobile">Mobile</h3>

			<p>Several months after the desktop site release, SmartEtailing released a mobile-specific template, which we volunteered to beta test. Like the desktop website, the mobile template had a minimal, neutral design. It also focused on product pages alone and didn&#8217;t incorporate informational pages. To match the desktop experience, I added some custom CSS and a homepage area to showcase regular features and brick-and-mortar services. </p>

				<p class="caption">Plano Cycling mobile website</p>
			</div>

			<h3 id="graphics">Graphics</h3>

			<p>For simplicity, I went with a common font stack for the website HTML, but the slider and hero graphics were open to some experimentation. I favored the Gotham font for a lot of these due to its beauty and flexibility. As a rule, the Plano Cycling primary red color and its variants were always featured in some way.</p>

			<h2 id="retrospect">Is it perfect?</h2>

			<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I did this project, and I&#8217;ve grown a lot as a designer. In retrospect I think there are a few things I would do differently.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Custom web fonts:</b> This didn&#8217;t factor into my thinking at the time, but I think web fonts would add readability and character.</li>
				<li><b>Mobile-friendly, but not responsive:</b> RWD was out of the realm of what I could accomplish at the time, and the CMS structure wouldn&#8217;t have been super helpful. I think SmartEtailing may support responsive designs better now.</li>
				<li><b>Deliverable not optimal:</b> Several pages use raw HTML instead of a WYSIWYG editor, whereas now I would favor maintainability. Fortunately, these pages don&#8217;t require much editing and there is knowledgable staff who can assist.</li>
			</ul>
