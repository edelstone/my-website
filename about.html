				<h2>How I work</h2>

				<p><b>What am I?</b> I’m a designer. Part visual, part experience, part animation, part code. And oh yeah, I write too. In a world of nebulous roles, I think this makes me a <a href="https://medium.com/@ericeriksson/9709572cb3ff">product designer</a> – and a pretty decent one. The important thing is this: I enjoy designing and building interfaces that are equal parts useful and beautiful. I make decisions with a reasonable amount of real-world evidence and a strong, mature bias to action.</p>
			
				<p><b>What sorts of problems do I solve?</b> I’m most-energized working at the nexus of content and design. Building modular components, <a href="/portfolio/texas-state-styleguide">creating style guides</a>, and writing smart web copy are areas I’ve owned in the past. I like being able to build and prototype what I design, so I’m fluent in much of the front end toolset and have been designing in the browser since 2009. I am constantly learning new things to enrich my personal life and professional craft; currently I’m getting into Sketch, flexbox, and vanilla JavaScript.</p>

				<p><b>Where am I coming from?</b> My social science education introduced me to the writing process and the importance of content organization early on. Years as a professional bicycle mechanic taught me creative problem solving and how to foster lasting customer relationships. I’ve proudly carried these talents forward into my design career. I keep humans at the center of my projects, and believe that words are the foundation of genuine digital experiences.</p>

				<p>I’ve worked for some stellar organizations that shared these ideals and helped me build an effective design process around them. Here’s a couple of them:</p>

				<h3>Texas State University</h3>
			
				<h4>2014 – 2017</h4>
			
				<p>I was the principal designer and front end specialist at <a href="http://txstate.edu">Texas State</a>, working across all of the university’s public web properties and ultimately defining their digital brand.</p>

				<p>I was directly responsible for the design and prototyping of a <a href="/portfolio/texas-state-template">responsive, scalable template</a> released to 400+ units in early 2016. I also led the design, front end development and content strategy for the school’s <a href="/portfolio/texas-state-homepage">first responsive homepage</a>. These updates gave me the opportunity to implement a much stronger digital brand identity, which I documented in a <a href="/portfolio/texas-state-styleguide">universal style guide</a> for both local publishers and the general public.</p>

				<p>Other notable successes include a <a href="https://jobs.hr.txstate.edu/">mobile-friendly jobs portal</a>, a thoughtful content strategy for the <a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/">University Marketing website</a> (including a <a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/about/team.html">fun team page</a>), improved <a href="http://www.styleguide.txstate.edu/patterns.html#emergency">emergency notifications</a>, a new <a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/library-demo">library homepage</a>, and the growth of a small web team that I helped recruit. My inclusive <a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/about/jobs/web-content-strategist.html">job</a> <a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/about/jobs/web-designer">announcements</a> got some accolades <a href="https://twitter.com/halvorson/status/768117011926908929">on Twitter</a> and influenced the culture of several university units.</p>

				<h3>Plano Cycling</h3>

				<h4>2012 – 2013</h4>
			
				<p>As lead designer at <a href="http://planocycling.com">Plano Cycling</a>, I proposed and executed digital initiatives on all customer-facing platforms: desktop, mobile, email, and social media.</p>

				<p>In March 2013, I designed and deployed a <a href="http://planocycling.com">new e-commerce website</a> for the shop, which included a deliberate brand identity and vibrant graphical style. I was also responsible for the new content strategy which balanced core <a href="http://planocycling.com/about/bicycle-fitting-pg762.htm">brick-and-mortar services</a> with <a href="http://planocycling.com/product-list/bikes-1000/">online shopping experiences</a> in an understandable way. Later I designed and shipped <a href="http://planocycling.com/m/">a mobile template</a> that dramatically increased engagement, as measured in increased mobile sales and improved key metrics on customer feedback surveys.</p>

				<p>Some other projects I worked on were the design and development of a <a href="http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1101657390717&ca=dd0eef30-bc89-4ca4-83a6-f9ae6451b72d">custom email template</a>, and a social media <a href="http://planocycling.com/events/oklahoma-tornado-relief-pg836.htm">campaign that raised thousands of dollars</a> in cash and goods for Oklahoma tornado victims.</p>

				<h2>I’m human too :)</h2>

				<p>I love the web. And movies. Just about all movies really. And let’s face it, <a href="codepen.io/tsanzer/pen/NAJqkY"><i>Stranger Things</i> was pretty freaking awesome</a>. I also love podcasts, space exploration, <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/ie1pr1j4v3xoHXW29">bicycles</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18UmsEMmCnD-Nw_pzG3fmYnuURfY&usp=sharing">national parks</a>, and road trips with <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/fPjx3izDvSSz9euR7">my BFF, Chloe</a>.</p>

				<p>I’m a depression survivor who values physical improvement, meaningful conversations, and alone time. I'm an open-minded centrist; not a huge fan of agendas, but also not easy to offend. I believe strongly that humanity is improving every day, and I try to do my part through charity and <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">effective altruism</a>.</p>

				<p>One of my long term goals is to build a tiny house in the mountains of New Mexico, and just kind of enjoy the scenery.</p>

				<h2>So, what’s next?</h2>

				<p>I’m proud of my accomplishments, but I’m certain I’ve only skimmed the surface of my potential. I want to get way better at this design stuff, and build some cool things while I’m at it.</p>

				<p>My ideal future team is supportive, talented, realistic, and design-focused, with at least a handful of folks who understand that the 1980s was objectively the best decade ever. I see myself at a small or medium-sized organization with a remote-friendly structure and a culture of trust, autonomy, and ownership. Ideally they have a sophisticated product or business direction, but embrace innovation and experimentation. Shipping design and code updates regularly would be awesome. (Bonus points for employers that match or incentivize charitable contributions).</p>

				<p>Be sure to check out <a href="/portfolio">my portfolio</a>, and if you think I’d help make your team or product greater, please reach out. Thanks again for reading.</p>
