				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
				<p>I’m Michael Edelstone, a product designer with some <a href="portfolio">significant contributions</a> to higher education and the bicycle industry. I made this website mostly from scratch. There's a basic <a href="styleguide.html">style guide</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/edelstone/my-website">source code is on GitHub</a>, if that interests you.</p>
				
				<p>And if you're not into the whole brevity thing, read on.</p>

				<h2 id="why">Why I Made This Page</h2>
				
				<p>I'm actively looking for my next full-time opportunity. I wrote this narrative r&eacute;sum&eacute; to help reach the <a href="#whats-next">type of team I want to work with</a> in a transparent way.</p>

				<h2 id="pursuits">Career Pursuits</h2>

				<p><span class="question"><b>What am I?</b></span> I’m a designer. Part visual, part experience, part information, part code. In the nebulous world of tech, I think this makes me a <a href="https://medium.com/@ericeriksson/9709572cb3ff">product designer</a>, or perhaps a <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/">front-end designer</a>, but that's not a big deal. The important thing is that <i>I care</i>.</p>
			
				<p><span class="question"><b>What problems do I solve?</b></span> I’m most energized working at the intersection of content and design. Building modular components, <a href="portfolio/texas-state-brand.html">creating style guides</a>, and writing clever web copy are areas I’ve enjoyed owning in the past. I like being able to build what I design, so I’m fluent in a lot of the front-end toolset and have been designing in the browser since 2009. I am constantly learning new things to enrich my personal life and craft; currently I’m getting deeper into Sketch, Jekyll, and flexbox.</p>

				<p><span class="question"><b>How did I get here?</b></span> My social science education introduced me to the writing process and the importance of content organization. Years as a professional bicycle mechanic taught me about creative problem solving and fostering long-term customer relationships. Now I use these talents to design and build interfaces that are equal parts useful and beautiful. I keep humans at the center of my projects, and make decisions with a reasonable amount of real-world evidence and a strong, mature bias to action.</p>

				<p>Lately I’ve worked for some stellar organizations that shared these principles, and helped me build an effective design process around them. For example:</p>
				
				<div id="accomplishments">
				
					<h3 id="texas-state">Texas State University</h3>
			
					<h4 class="lil-snug-guy">2014 – 2017</h4>
			
					<p>I was recently the principal designer at <a href="http://txstate.edu">Texas State</a>, working across all of the university’s public web properties and ultimately defining their digital brand.</p>

					<p>I was directly responsible for the design and prototyping of a <a href="portfolio/texas-state-template.html">responsive, scalable template</a> released to 400+ units in early 2016. Simultaneously I led the design, front-end development, and content strategy for the school’s <a href="portfolio/texas-state-homepage.html">first responsive homepage</a>. These updates gave me the opportunity to implement a compelling digital identity, which I documented in a <a href="portfolio/texas-state-brand.html">universal style guide</a> for local publishers and the general public. Our lead developer and myself recently discussed this project on <a href="https://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/texas-state/">the RWD Podcast</a>.</p>

					<p>Other notable successes include a <a href="https://jobs.hr.txstate.edu/">mobile-friendly jobs portal</a>, a thoughtful content strategy for the <a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/">University Marketing website</a> (including a <a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/about/team.html">fun team page</a>), improved <a href="portfolio/texas-state-homepage.html#alerts">emergency notifications</a>, a new main library homepage (<a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/library-demo">demo</a>), and the growth of a small web team I helped recruit. My <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Web-Content-Strategist-xuBtEhI8qXR3Qfcke5DMs">inclusive job announcements</a> got some accolades <a href="https://twitter.com/halvorson/status/768117011926908929">on Twitter</a> and influenced the culture of several university units.</p>

					<h3 id="plano-cycling">Plano Cycling and Fitness</h3>

					<h4 class="lil-snug-guy">2012 – 2013</h4>
			
					<p>As lead designer at <a href="http://planocycling.com">Plano Cycling</a>, I proposed and executed digital initiatives on all customer-facing platforms: desktop, mobile, email, and social media.</p>

					<p>In March 2013, I designed and deployed a <a href="portfolio/plano-cycling-website.html">new e-commerce website</a> for the shop, with an updated brand identity and <a href="portfolio/plano-cycling-website.html#graphics">vibrant graphical style</a>. I was also responsible for the new content strategy which balanced core <a href="http://planocycling.com/about/bicycle-fitting-pg762.htm">brick-and-mortar services</a> with the <a href="http://planocycling.com/product-list/bikes-1000/">online shopping experience</a> in a logical way. Later I added a <a href="portfolio/plano-cycling-website.html#mobile">mobile-specific template</a> that dramatically increased sales and improved key metrics on customer feedback surveys.</p>

					<p>Some other projects I worked on were the design and development of a <a href="http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1101657390717&ca=dd0eef30-bc89-4ca4-83a6-f9ae6451b72d">custom email template</a>, and a social media <a href="http://planocycling.com/events/oklahoma-tornado-relief-pg836.htm">campaign that raised thousands of dollars</a> in cash and goods for Oklahoma tornado victims.</p>

				</div>
				
				<h2 id="im-human">I’m human too :)</h2>

				<p>I love the web. And movies. Just about all movies really. And <a href="http://codepen.io/edelstone/full/NAJqkY/"><i>Stranger Things</i> was pretty freaking awesome</a>. I also love podcasts, space exploration, <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/ie1pr1j4v3xoHXW29">bicycles</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18UmsEMmCnD-Nw_pzG3fmYnuURfY&usp=sharing">national parks</a>, and road trips with <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/fPjx3izDvSSz9euR7">my BFF, Chloe</a>.</p>

				<p>I’m a depression survivor who values physical improvement, meaningful conversations, and alone time. I consider myself an open-minded centrist; not a huge fan of agendas, but also not easy to offend. I believe strongly that humanity is improving every day, and I try to do my part through charity and <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">effective altruism</a>.</p>

				<p>One of my long term goals is to build a tiny house in the mountains of New Mexico, and just kind of enjoy the scenery.</p>

				<h2 id="whats-next">So, what’s next?</h2>

				<p>I’m proud of my accomplishments, but I know I’ve barely touched the surface of my potential. I want to get way better at this stuff, and influence lots of cool things while I’m at it.</p>

				<p>My ideal future team is supportive, intelligent, realistic, funny, super creative, and design-focused, with at least a handful of folks who know that the 1980s was objectively the best decade ever.</p>
				
				<p>I see myself at a small or medium-sized, remote-friendly organization, with a culture that values individual contributors, trust, and autonomy. Ideally they rally around a mature(ish) product or business initiative their users love, but still embrace innovation and experimentation. Pushing new things into the real world regularly, and being able to influence broader business decisions, would be awesome. (Bonus points for employers that match charitable contributions).</p>
				
				<h2 id="lets-work">Let's work together</h2>
