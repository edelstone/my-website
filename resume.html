			<p><span class="inline-header">What am I?</span> I’m a designer. Part visual, part experience, part information, part code. This might make me a <a href="https://medium.com/@ericeriksson/9709572cb3ff">product designer</a> or perhaps a <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/">front-end designer</a>, but these are mostly just labels. The important thing is that I care about the quality of the work I produce – from end to end.</p>

			<p><span class="inline-header">What problems do I solve?</span> I’m most energized working on complex user experience and visual design challenges. Building modular components, <a href="/portfolio/texas-state-brand">creating design systems</a>, and improving product features are areas I’ve enjoyed owning in the past. I like being able to build what I dream up, so I’m fluent in much of the front-end toolset and have been designing in the browser for my entire career. I&#8217;m constantly learning new things to challenge my brain and improve my process; currently I’m getting deeper into Sketch, Sass, and vanilla JavaScript.</p>

			<p><span class="inline-header">How did I get here?</span> My social science education introduced me to the writing process and the importance of content organization. Years as a professional bicycle mechanic taught me about creative problem solving and fostering long-term customer relationships. Now I use these talents to design and build interfaces that are equal parts useful and beautiful.</p>

			<p>Lately I’ve worked for some stellar organizations that shared these principles, and helped me build an effective design process around them. For example:</p>

				<h3 id="texas-state">Texas State University</h3>

				<h4 class="lil-snug-guy">2014 – 2017</h4>

				<p>I was recently the principal designer and CMS lead at <a href="http://txstate.edu">Texas State University</a>, working across all of their public web properties and ultimately defining their digital brand.</p>

				<p>I was directly responsible for the design and prototyping of a <a href="/portfolio/texas-state-template">responsive template</a> released to 400+ units in early 2016. Simultaneously I led the design and front-end development for the school’s <a href="/portfolio/texas-state-homepage">first responsive homepage</a>. These updates gave me the opportunity to implement a compelling digital identity, which I documented in a <a href="/portfolio/texas-state-brand">universal style guide</a> for local publishers and the general public. Our lead developer and myself recently discussed these projects on <a href="https://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/texas-state/">the RWD Podcast</a>.</p>

				<p>Other notable successes include a <a href="https://jobs.hr.txstate.edu/">mobile-friendly jobs portal</a>, a thoughtful content strategy for the <a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/">University Marketing website</a> (including a <a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/about/team.html">fun team page</a>), improved <a href="/portfolio/texas-state-homepage#alerts">emergency notifications</a>, a new main library homepage (<a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/library-demo">demo</a>), and the growth of a small web team I helped recruit. My inclusive job announcements got some accolades <a href="https://twitter.com/halvorson/status/768117011926908929">on Twitter</a> and influenced the culture of several university units.</p>

				<h3 id="plano-cycling">Plano Cycling &amp; Fitness</h3>

				<h4 class="lil-snug-guy">2012 – 2014</h4>

				<p>As lead designer at <a href="http://planocycling.com">Plano Cycling</a>, I proposed and executed digital initiatives on all customer-facing platforms: desktop, mobile, email, and social media.</p>

				<p>In March 2013, I shipped a <a href="/portfolio/plano-cycling-website">new e-commerce website</a> for the shop, with an updated brand identity and <a href="/portfolio/plano-cycling-website#graphics">vibrant graphical style</a>. I was also responsible for the new content strategy which balanced core <a href="http://planocycling.com/about/bicycle-fitting-pg762.htm">brick-and-mortar services</a> with the <a href="http://planocycling.com/product-list/bikes-1000/">online shopping experience</a> in a logical way. Later I added a <a href="/portfolio/plano-cycling-website#mobile">mobile-specific template</a> that dramatically increased sales and improved key metrics on customer feedback surveys.</p>

				<p>Some other projects I worked on were the design and development of a <a href="http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1101657390717&ca=dd0eef30-bc89-4ca4-83a6-f9ae6451b72d">custom email template</a>, and a social media <a href="http://planocycling.com/events/oklahoma-tornado-relief-pg836.htm">campaign that raised thousands of dollars</a> for Oklahoma tornado victims.</p>

			</div>

			<h2 id="im-human">I’m human too :)</h2>

			<p>I love the web. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/list/ls062779538/?sort=created:desc">And movies</a>. Just about all movies really. And <a href="http://codepen.io/edelstone/pen/NAJqkY"><i>Stranger Things</i> was pretty freaking awesome</a>. I also love <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ibakW6gsRauxRT9D3">bicycles</a>, astronomy, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18UmsEMmCnD-Nw_pzG3fmYnuURfY&usp=sharing">national parks</a>, and road trips with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dZmnf8guXIF7MCxw1">my BFF, Chloe</a>.</p>

			<p>One of my long term goals is to build a tiny house in the mountains of New Mexico, and just kind of enjoy the scenery.</p>

			<h2 id="whats-next">So, what’s next?</h2>

			<p>I’m proud of my accomplishments, but I know I’ve barely touched the surface of my potential. I want to get way better at this stuff, and influence lots of cool things while I’m at it.</p>

			<p>My ideal future team is supportive, intelligent, realistic, funny, super creative, and design-focused, with at least a handful of folks who know that the 1980s was objectively the best decade ever.</p>

			<p>I see myself at a small or medium-sized organization, with a culture that values individual contributors, trust, and autonomy. Ideally they rally around a mature(ish) product or business initiative their users love, but still embrace innovation and experimentation. Pushing new things into the real world regularly, and being able to influence broader business decisions, would be awesome. (Bonus points for remote-first culture or donation matching).</p>
