This is the source code for [michaeledelstone.com](http://michaeledelstone.com). It's a fun little playground intended to showcase my design abilities and reach the best clients and teams around.

**[There's a style guide too, if you're interested](http://michaeledelstone.com/styleguide).**

## Goals

* Explain who I am and what I'm all about, humbly and transparently
* Demonstrate my most recent work for future clients and employers, as well as the design and tech communities
* Experiment with design techniques, color, typography, and CSS
* Start writing and posting articles and insights with some regularity

## Primary design considerations

* Responsive and future-thinking
* Unique, fun, professional
* Semantic markup and stylesheets, with minimal scripting
* Universal and accessible design
* Interesting and honest content
* Animated feel with thoughtful colors, textures, and type

## How it's built

I developed the site without frameworks, templates, or a content management system. It's all hand-coded HTML and CSS, with a handful of things I borrowed or remixed from various open source projects.
