This is the source code for [michaeledelstone.com](https://michaeledelstone.com).

I developed the site without frameworks or a content management system. It's all hand-coded HTML and CSS, with a handful of scripts and plugins I borrowed from various open source projects. It's generated using Jekyll.

Many thanks to the digital community for these bad boys:
