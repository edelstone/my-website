This is the source code for [michaeledelstone.com](https://michaeledelstone.com). It's a fun little playground intended to showcase my design abilities and reach the best teams around.

**[There's a style guide, if you're interested](https://michaeledelstone.com/styleguide).**

## Goals

* Explain who I am and what I'm all about, humbly and transparently
* Demonstrate recent design work and current technical capabilities
* Experiment with design techniques, color, typography, and CSS

## Primary design considerations

* Responsive and future-thinking
* Unique, fun, professional
* Semantic, valid markup and stylesheets, with minimal scripting
* Universal and accessible design
* Interesting and honest content
* Animated feel with thoughtful colors, patterns, and typography

## How it's built

I developed the site without frameworks or a content management system. It's all hand-coded HTML and CSS, with a handful of scripts and plugins I borrowed from various open source projects. It's generated using Jekyll and CDN'd/encrypted/optimized via Cloudfare.
