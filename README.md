## As of 2024 this repo is archived and there's a [new version of my website](https://github.com/edelstone/my-website-2).

This is the source code for [michaeledelstone.com](https://michaeledelstone.com).

I developed the site without frameworks or a content management system. It's all custom HTML and CSS, with a handful of scripts and plugins I borrowed from various open source projects. It's generated using Jekyll.
