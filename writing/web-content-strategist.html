		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p><a href="http://txstate.edu">Texas State University</a> is hiring a Web Content Strategist to tackle our biggest, public-facing web projects and deliver a best-in-class experience for website visitors.</p>
		<p>It’s a one year, fixed-term project position with full-time hours and complete benefits. We cover this in greater detail below.</p>
		<h3>About University Marketing</h3>
		<p>You’ll join <a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/about/team">a small group of creatives</a> operating a bit like an agency within the university. We communicate on Slack, debate about Central Texas barbecue, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BEwGkXlBCiO/">geek</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/txst/status/595277984019288065">out</a> <a href="http://www.txstate.edu/prospectiveflash/misc/txst_thor.jpg">about</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/txst/status/660568239089573888">movies</a> (or, more recently, <a href="http://makeitstranger.com/university-marketing"><em>Stranger Things</em></a>), and produce really solid <a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/about/portfolio">work that delights our partners and makes us proud</a>.</p>
		<p>Our web team is both very lean and highly autonomous. We’ve established ourselves as an authority on front-end web issues and are trusted with the highest-impact projects available. We get to help people every day, and our efforts are appreciated across campus and <a href="http://responsivewebdesign.com/podcast/texas-state/">by the web community</a>.</p>
		<h3>History and Challenges</h3>
		<p>Texas State has about 400 websites and 50,000 public webpages, most of which are published inside <a href="http://gato.its.txstate.edu">our content management system</a>. Due to volume, we rely on individual units to write, organize, govern and strategize their own content with little institutional support. Only a handful of departments employ a dedicated web professional, so results vary … a lot.</p>
		<p>Like much of the public sector, we’re a bit behind from a digital perspective. The good news is that we’ve made some progress on the web recently, and we’re building systems to ensure this trend continues. In the last eight months we’ve:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>moved every unit over to our first <a href="http://www.reslife.txstate.edu">responsive</a>, <a href="http://www.txstate.edu/commonexperience">multi-column</a> <a href="http://www.meadowscenter.txstate.edu">template</a></li>
			<li>released our first <a href="http://www.txstate.edu">responsive home page</a></li>
			<li>introduced a <a href="http://www.styleguide.txstate.edu">thoughtful and scalable design system</a></li>
			<li>launched <a href="http://www.umarketing.txstate.edu/capabilities/web">in-depth consultations with web publishers</a></li>
			<li>open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/txstate-etc/gato">our CMS implementation</a></li>
			<li>built a cross-departmental web team that you’ll be a part of</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>About You</h3>
		<p>We’re looking for someone that has a deep understanding of the web, and how content and design fit together.</p>
		<p>Ideally you have some experience with the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>independently identifying digital problems or gaps, and advocating for solutions</li>
			<li>managing, growing and publishing a complex website, preferably in a CMS</li>
			<li>using website analytics to inform content decisions</li>
			<li>performing site audits and planning information architecture</li>
			<li>crafting beautiful, concise web copy</li>
			<li>communicating with clients of varying levels of technical or creative ability</li>
			<li>working within defined brand guidelines - or developing your own</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What You’ll Be Doing</h3>
		<p>Paired with our lead designer, you’ll be an integral part of the creative process, focusing on a wide variety of content-related initiatives. You may be conducting site audits, architecting site maps, wireframing content widgets, interviewing clients and test subjects, writing web copy, or extracting information from Google Analytics.</p>
		<p>Specifically, there will be two major jobs to tackle:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>You’ll lead the content strategy for a ground-up overhaul of <a href="http://www.thewittliffcollections.txstate.edu">The Wittliff Collections website</a> as we move them toward an elegant, museum-level experience.</li>
			<li>When that’s done, we’ll take everything we learned and apply it to the <a href="http://www.txstate.edu">Texas State home page</a> and <a href="http://www.txstate.edu/discover">top-level</a> <a href="http://www.txstate.edu/beabobcat">subpages</a>, moving us from <a href="http://www.txstate.edu/future">lengthy indexes</a> to a targeted and engaging user experience.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Our Design Stack</h3>
		<p>There’s no substitute for a strong ability to learn and adapt to new processes, but an existing background with some or all of these will be extremely beneficial: macOS, content management systems, responsive web design, HTML/CSS, Adobe CC, Sketch, Balsamiq, UXPin, Google Analytics, and GitHub.</p>
		<p>Bonus points if you’re familiar with OmniGraffle, Axure, Treejack or similar software.</p>
		<h3>Job Details and Benefits</h3>
		<p>This position is categorized as a full-time, fixed-term project position with a duration of one year to start. It’s funded jointly by Information Technology and University Marketing, but practically speaking you’ll be part of University Marketing and report to <a href="http://umarketing.txstate.edu/about/team#dan">our director</a>.</p>
		<p><span class="inline-header">Salary:</span> $45,900 - $55,900, depending on qualifications</p>
		<p><span class="inline-header">Benefits:</span></p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.hr.txstate.edu/Holiday-Schedule">two week winter break</a> (send us a postcard!)</li>
			<li>12 vacation days (or more, depending on prior state service)</li>
			<li>12 sick days</li>
			<li>100% paid medical insurance, plus 50% dependent coverage</li>

			<li><a href="http://www.hr.txstate.edu/New-Employee-Welcome/Bobcat-Benefits">a bunch of other stuff</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>We’ll set you up with a 27-inch Mac and get you whatever software and books you need to do your job well. You’ll have a sit/stand desk in our newly renovated offices (completed in October) on the 8th floor of the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/N6mX7NDxjAR2">J.C. Kellam building</a>.</p>
		<p>FYI: That’s just one block from <a href="http://www.txstate.edu/about/history-traditions/sewell-park">the San Marcos River</a>, where you’re welcome to join us for a lunchtime swim or picnic. Did we mention that Texas State University has <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/txstateu/albums/72157661543645409">the most beautiful campus in Texas</a>?</p>
